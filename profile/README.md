# ReUni-Project

These repos are basically record of my journey through the computer science major in university. 
I'm using this org to help organize all these projects. I've listed all the cs courses I've taken 
in university and a brief explaination about the course. Many of these courses had a course project 
and I wanted to try and go back and recreate them from scratch. Some of them did not have projects 
but I think it had enough content to create a new project that shows what I've learned from the 
course. I might also add mini projects if there are enough content that were not really focused on
in the original projects. I've also included some project from classes that were not categorized as 
cs courses but were still programming heavy.

❗ These remakes, **NOT** the originals I or my team submitted! All the code here are by me. ❗

Why am I remaking them? Its just for fun and practice / review! The main idea / functions for the 
most part are the same, the remakes may add some polish, extra features, etc. Some of them may 
actually be simpler then the original...

## cs100 | Introduction to the Profession

**Course Summary:**

CS100 was one of the first courses I had to take, it was to show what the industry is like and 
what the major is like. I got to work with real companies in this course to experience first hand 
what it would be like to work in the industry! There was no real course project for us but if we 
chose to work with a company during this course, we had sort of a project to work on.

**Original Project:** 

My group and the company we worked with decided to make a financial calculator to help with 
planning out debt and financial aid. We didn't really write any code for it, mainly just google 
slides for the ui. Just learning about the work flow of working in the tech industry, not really 
learning any programming.

**Remake Project Idea:**

Basic College Finance Calculator

## cs115 | Object Oriented Programming I

### Course Summary:

CS115 was the first real programming course I took in university. It covered the basics of object 
oriented programming, java, and common programming practices. This course did not include 
recursion, exception handling, or File I/O iirc.

### Original Project:

A dice game where you roll 2 die and try to eliminate all the numbers 1 to 12. The ui was just 
text in the terminal. You can either eliminate the sum of the 2 numbers rolled by the 2 dice or 
eliminate the 2 individual numbers. You lose if neither option is availabe or you win after 
elimiating all the numbers. 

### Remake Project Idea: 

I think the original was based on *Shut the box*, and I want to make that. I stuck to just the 
terminal for the ui but made it look better then just minimul text. The rules will be based on the 
actual game but with expanded modes and a score board. I might add ai bots to play this but it 
would be a seperate project maybe in cs480 or cs587. I stuck with mostly the basics covered in 
cs115 but also some stuff from cs116 and stuff that were not covered at all like the `.stream` 
stuff.

## cs116 | Object Oriented Programming II

**Course Summary:**

This course was the continuation of Object Oriented Programming I. We learned about more advanced 
syntax and concepts such as recursion and exception handling. We also started to work with object 
oriented programming concepts like abstract classes, polymorphism, and inheritance.

**Original Project:** 

The course project was to make our own custom java data frame and a few basic functions to go with 
it. Java doesn't have a built in data frame like how python does so we were tasked to make our own.
For the remake, I want make this data frame and then make a book library application on top of the 
data frame. We also were not able to fully implement all the functions we were asked of when we 
took the course so I feel that I should do so for completion sake.

**Remake Project Idea:**

Custom Data Frame + Book Library

For our course project, we chose to make our own version of the grade tracking program the 
university was using. The original site / program my university used for tracking grades and 
assignments was called blackboard so we called ours whiteboard. We didn't actually right any code 
so the project didn't have any functionality. We only made plans and some ui, no real code.

## Other | Other Projects

**Summary:**

There were a few other courses I took during my time at the university that was not under the 
computer science department but were still programming heavy and had projects I think are worth 
trying to remake.

**Original Projects:** 

In my COM 421 | Technical Communications course, we had to make several basic websites so I think 
I could make a basic website here for a remake. I can try different tricks with css and html.

For my Ipro I | Cyber Innovation and Tech Entrepreneurship, my group chose to make a chrome 
extension that would scan for privacy polices and provide a pop up summary. This project touched 
on many different things I've yet to do on my own such as creating a scraper, browser extentions 
and AI api interactions.
